# Project 1: Customer Segmentation Analysis using K-Means clustering

**Objective:**  
This project analyzes customer purchase behavior using **RFM analysis** and **K-Means clustering**, uncovering key customer groups and behavioral patterns.  
The insights are designed to support marketing and CRM teams in **personalized targeting, retention, and campaign optimization**.

## Data Overview

**Data Period:** April 1st – June 30th, 2025  
**Datasets Used:**
- `sales`: order-level data (sale_id, sale_date, customer_id, order_amount, country, channel)
- `sales_item`: item-level data (product_id, price, quantity, customer_id, sale_id)
- `customer`: demographic data (customer_id, age_range, signup_date, country)

## Analytical Approach

1. **RFM Segmentation**
   - Recency, Frequency, Monetary scoring to categorize customers:
     - 🏆 *Champions* — high frequency, high recency, high value  
     - 💎 *Loyal customers* — frequent and recent buyers  
     - ⚠️ *At-risk customers* — long inactive but historically high spenders  
     - 💔 *Lost customers* — inactive, low engagement  

2. **Behavioral Deep Dive**
   - Purchase interval and time-of-day trends  
   - Channel reliance (e.g., website vs. app)  
   - Product category preference and average order value  
   - Demographic persona differences  
   - Lifecycle analysis: registration-to-first-purchase time  

3. **Clustering with K-Means**
   - Behavioral feature normalization  
   - Elbow method for optimal k  
   - Cluster interpretation by product preference, spend, and recency

## Key Insights

- **High-value customers** (Champions) drive ~60% of total revenue; mostly aged 25–34, prefer direct web channel.  
- **At-risk customers** show a declining trend in frequency; targeted reactivation campaigns can be designed around seasonal promotions.  
- **Loyal customers** respond strongly to product category discounts, suggesting potential for personalized bundling.  
- **Lost customers** tend to have short early engagement — onboarding optimization could extend lifecycle.
